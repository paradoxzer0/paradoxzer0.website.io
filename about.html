      <p>I've grown up having videogames for almost as long as I could remember. They've
      been a huge part of my life, helping me make some new friends who share my love of
      games. To me, videogames are more than just a form of entertainment, they're a way
      to connect with other people. Whether it's online or offline, you can always find
      friends with videogames.</p>
