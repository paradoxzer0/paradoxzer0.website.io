    <h2>Side Note<h2>

      <p>One of the aspects that gives Overwatch so much more flare than its other FPS counterparts is that each character has their own unique personality. From a Japanese, sword-swinging cyborg-ninja, to a 19 year-old Korean pro gaming streamer in a million dollar mech-suit, this game has no shortage of wacky characters.</p>

    <p>Overwatch takes special care to make sure that no part of its game is
      overpowered or unbalanced. While this is a very difficult task to do in a game with
      24 different characters, and even more on the way, Blizzard Entertainment has
      managed to do an overall great job with balancing the game out, with a few
      exceptions. One aspect that might be overlooked, but is in fact one of the most
      crucial to understand is the concept of healing versus damaging. In one of the most
      recent metas, it was a very bad decision to choose a hero that was meant to deal
      backline damage. Why? Well, it was because the enemy team was most likely running a
      team of tank and support heroes, and the tanks would make it very difficult for a
      hero like Genji to do any damage to their backlines. Was it impossible to play these
      damage heroes? Not at all, but due to the state the game was in at the time, it
      meant that if you wanted to get value out of that hero, you had to do one thing,
      confirm the kill. This was because if you did damage to a target, but didn't finish
      them off as soon as possible, then all you did was give ultimate ability charge, or
      "ult", to the enemy team's support heroes. How bad could that really be though?
      Well, it's incredibly bad due to a hero called Ana.</p>

      <h1>So, Who's Ana?</h1>

      <p>By far, Ana has one of the most influential ults in the game. While it's not as cool sounding as creating a miniature black-hole or summoning two dragons out of thin air, it certainly is just as, if not more, powerful than those. For those who don't know, Ana's ultimate ability is to give one other player on her team a boost, otherwise known as "Nano-boost". This boost gives the applied player a damage boost and damage resistance for about 8 seconds. You may be think, "8 seconds? that doesn't seem like all that long. what could someone possibly do in that time?" Well, depending on who they gave it to, quite a lot. There are many characters who giving this boost too will create a lot of trouble for the enemy team, such as Reinhardt, Pharah, Reaper, or Winston, but one good example of this is Genji. On his own, Genji is able to do a good amount of damage, give him a nano-boost and he will be able to absolutley shred through players health, give him a nano-boost while he's using his own ult will mean the annihalation of the entire enemy team. That's how bad it could really be.</p>

    <section class="topic3">

    <h1>How Is This Balanced?</h1>

    <p>Well, in order for Ana to build up ult charge, she has to do one of two things: do damage, or heal. While damaging the enemy team does help her build her ult, its not nearly as easy or consistent as healing injured teammates. This is where the danger of doing damage comes back into play, beacuase Ana can't heal her teammate if they don't need to be healed, or can't be healed because they're dead. So, you can try to build your own ult by doing damage to an enemy player, but just know that if you don't finish them off, you might very well have a superpowered cyborg-ninja slashing away at your entire team.</p>
