    <p>Overwatch takes special care to make sure that no part of its game is
      overpowered or unbalanced. While this is a very difficult task to do in a game with
      24 different characters, and even more on the way, Blizzard Entertainment has
      managed to do an overall great job with balancing the game out, with a few
      exceptions. One aspect that might be overlooked, but is in fact one of the most
      crucial to understand is the concept of healing versus damaging. In one of the most
      recent metas, it was a very bad decision to choose a hero that was meant to deal
      backline damage. Why? Well, it was because the enemy team was most likely running a
      team of tank and support heroes, and the tanks would make it very difficult for a
      hero like Genji to do any damage to their backlines. Was it impossible to play these
      damage heroes? Not at all, but due to the state the game was in at the time, it
      meant that if you wanted to get value out of that hero, you had to do one thing,
      confirm the kill. This was because if you did damage to a target, but didn't finish
      them off as soon as possible, then all you did was give ultimate ability charge, or
      "ult", to the enemy team's support heroes. How bad could that really be though?
      Well, it's incredibly bad due to a hero called Ana.</p>
